At its core, it is an instant messaging app that allows users to play tabletop roleplaying games asynchronously. The app includes a set of creator tools that empower users to modify game systems and other content in their library, mod games on the fly while playing, and even publish original content to the marketplace. It uses Flutter for the UI, AWS for the database, Hasura to generate a GraphQL API to interface with the database, and Firebase for user authentication.',

Previously, we showed a list of all available consultants and allowed users to connect with anyone they chose, so the requests were not always a good fit and both sides got frustrated. To solve this problem, we streamlined the whole process by making the help request form front and center for the user. We also gave consultants the ability to specify which topics they were willing to help in. My role in this project was to mock up the initial designs in Photoshop for the help request page that lists the consultants available for a given request, and then to code all of the CSS to pull it off.
